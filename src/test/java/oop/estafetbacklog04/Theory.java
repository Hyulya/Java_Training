1) What Are Interfaces in Java? - an abstract type that contains a collection of methods and constant variables.
How can we use them? - Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction, polymorphism and multiple inheritances.
What problem do they solve? -

2) What Are Abstract classes in Java? How can we use them? What problem do they solve?

3) What are the differences between abstract, static, and default methods?

4) What is Polymorphism and what problem does it solve?

5) What are the differences and similarities between Abstract classes and Interfaces after Java 8?

6) Where we can store constants, so they can be available in classes without creating an instance of an object?

7) What access modifiers we can use in abstract classes and interfaces?

8) Can we use the final keyword in Interfaces and Abstract classes?

9) What are functional interfaces?

10) Inheritance with Interfaces and abstract classes

* Can we have inheritance between Interfaces?

* Can we have inheritance between abstract classes?

* Can a class have a relationship with an abstract class and interface at the same time?

* Can a class have a relationship with an abstract class and a normal class at the same time?
