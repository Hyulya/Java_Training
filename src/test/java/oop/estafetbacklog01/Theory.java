    /*
- What’s a class?
  --> It's the template/blueprint that we use for creating objects.

- What’s the difference between class and objects?
  --> The object is an instance of a class, the class is the template used for creating that object.

- Name all manners in which a class is instantiated?
  --> By initializing an object of that class (calling the constructor and creating an object like this: ClassName objName = new ClassName();
  --> By the static factory method -
  Bonus :) --> Abstract classes can't be instantiated, but they can be sub-classes - so that the it provides imps for all
               abstract methods in its parent class.

- Where in the memory are objects stored? - In the heap memory

- What’s the connection between the class and the java file it resides?
  --> The .class file is a compiled .java file.
  --> .java is all text and is human-readable
  --> .class is binary

- What’s an instance?
  --> It's the realization of an object

- What’s the difference between a method and a constructor?
   --> Constructors create objects, methods are for perform the functionality of these objects

- How can we access a property of a class if we have an object of that class?
   --> We put a dot after typing the object and can see all the class properties through this object

- Can we use this() in a method? - Yes

- Can we call methods within a constructor? - No

- Can we call methods within other methods? - Yes
