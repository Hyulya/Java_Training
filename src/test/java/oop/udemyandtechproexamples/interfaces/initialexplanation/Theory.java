/*
An interface in Java specifies methods that a particular class that implements the interface must implement.
The interface itself is abstract - there's no actual code for any of the methods,
you only supply the actual method names and the parameters. The actual code still goes in the actual class that you're creating.
The idea of using an interface is to provide a common behaviour that can be used by several classes
by having them all implement the same interface. So it's a way to standardize the way a particular set of classed is used.
